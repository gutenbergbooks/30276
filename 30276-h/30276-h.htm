<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In March, 1914, a volume appeared entitled "Des Imagistes." It was a
collection of the work of various young poets, presented together as a
school. This school has been widely discussed by those interested in new
movements in the arts, and has already become a household word.
Differences of taste and judgment, however, have arisen among the
contributors to that book; growing tendencies are forcing them along
different paths. Those of us whose work appears in this volume have
therefore decided to publish our collection under a new title, and we have
been joined by two or three poets who did not contribute to the first
volume, our wider scope making this possible.</p>

<p>In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that
of the former Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor,
each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers
his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared
in book form. A sort of informal committee&mdash;consisting of more than half
the authors here represented&mdash;have arranged the book and decided what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>should be printed and what omitted, but, as a general rule, the poets
have been allowed absolute freedom in this direction, limitations of space
only being imposed upon them. Also, to avoid any appearance of precedence,
they have been put in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>As it has been suggested that much of the misunderstanding of the former
volume was due to the fact that we did not explain ourselves in a preface,
we have thought it wise to tell the public what our aims are, and why we
are banded together between one set of covers.</p>

<p>The poets in this volume do not represent a clique. Several of them are
personally unknown to the others, but they are united by certain common
principles, arrived at independently. These principles are not new; they
have fallen into desuetude. They are the essentials of all great poetry,
indeed of all great literature, and they are simply these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ always the <i>exact</i>
word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word.</p>

<p>2. To create new rhythms&mdash;as the expression of new moods&mdash;and not to copy
old rhythms, which merely echo old moods. We do not insist upon
"free-verse" as the only method of writing poetry. We fight for it as for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>a principle of liberty. We believe that the individuality of a poet may
often be better expressed in free-verse than in conventional forms. In
poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.</p>

<p>3. To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject. It is not good art
to write badly about aeroplanes and automobiles; nor is it necessarily bad
art to write well about the past. We believe passionately in the artistic
value of modern life, but we wish to point out that there is nothing so
uninspiring nor so old-fashioned as an aeroplane of the year 1911.</p>

<p>4. To present an image (hence the name: "Imagist"). We are not a school of
painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and
not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is
for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk
the real difficulties of his art.</p>

<p>5. To produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.</p>

<p>6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence
of poetry.</p>

<p>The subject of free-verse is too complicated to be discussed here. We may
say briefly, that we attach the term to all that increasing amount of
writing whose cadence is more marked, more definite, and closer knit than
that of prose, but which is not so violently nor so obviously accented as
the so-called "regular verse." We refer those interested in the question
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> the Greek Melic poets, and to the many excellent French studies on the
subject by such distinguished and well-equipped authors as Remy de
Gourmont, Gustave Kahn, Georges Duhamel, Charles Vildrac, Henri Gh&eacute;on,
Robert de Souza, Andr&eacute; Spire, etc.</p>

<p>We wish it to be clearly understood that we do not represent an exclusive
artistic sect; we publish our work together because of mutual artistic
sympathy, and we propose to bring out our co&ouml;perative volume each year for
a short term of years, until we have made a place for ourselves and our
principles such as we desire.</p>

<tr><td>I hate that town;<br />
I hate the town I lived in when I was little;<br />
I hate to think of it.<br />
There were always clouds, smoke, rain<br />
In that dingy little valley.<br />
It rained; it always rained.<br />
I think I never saw the sun until I was nine&mdash;<br />
And then it was too late;<br />
Everything's too late after the first seven years.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
That long street we lived in<br />
Was duller than a drain<br />
And nearly as dingy.<br />
There were the big College<br />
And the pseudo-Gothic town-hall.<br />
There were the sordid provincial shops&mdash;<br />
The grocer's, and the shops for women,<br />
The shop where I bought transfers,<br />
And the piano and gramaphone shop<br />
Where I used to stand<br />
Staring at the huge shiny pianos and at the pictures<br />
Of a white dog looking into a gramaphone.<br />
<br />
How dull and greasy and grey and sordid it was!<br />
On wet days&mdash;it was always wet&mdash;<br />
I used to kneel on a chair<br />
And look at it from the window.<br />
<br />
The dirty yellow trams<br />
Dragged noisily along<br />
With a clatter of wheels and bells<br />
And a humming of wires overhead.<br />
They threw up the filthy rain-water from the hollow lines<br />
And then the water ran back<br />
Full of brownish foam bubbles.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
There was nothing else to see&mdash;<br />
It was all so dull&mdash;<br />
Except a few grey legs under shiny black umbrellas<br />
Running along the grey shiny pavements;<br />
Sometimes there was a waggon<br />
Whose horses made a strange loud hollow sound<br />
With their hoofs<br />
Through the silent rain.<br />
<br />
And there was a grey museum<br />
Full of dead birds and dead insects and dead animals<br />
And a few relics of the Romans&mdash;dead also.<br />
There was the sea-front,<br />
A long asphalt walk with a bleak road beside it,<br />
Three piers, a row of houses,<br />
And a salt dirty smell from the little harbour.<br />
<br />
I was like a moth&mdash;-<br />
Like one of those grey Emperor moths<br />
Which flutter through the vines at Capri.<br />
And that damned little town was my match-box,<br />
Against whose sides I beat and beat<br />
Until my wings were torn and faded, and dingy<br />
As that damned little town.</td></tr>

They taught me pothooks&mdash;<br />
I wanted to be alone, although I was so little,<br />
Alone, away from the rain, the dingyness, the dullness,<br />
Away somewhere else&mdash;<br />
<br />
The town was dull;<br />
The front was dull;<br />
The High Street and the other street were dull&mdash;<br />
And there was a public park, I remember,<br />
And that was damned dull too,<br />
With its beds of geraniums no one was allowed to pick,<br />
And its clipped lawns you weren't allowed to walk on,<br />
And the gold-fish pond you mustn't paddle in,<br />
And the gate made out of a whale's jaw-bones,<br />
And the swings, which were for "Board-School children,"<br />
And its gravel paths.<br />
<br />
And on Sundays they rang the bells,<br />
From Baptist and Evangelical and Catholic churches.<br />
They had the Salvation Army.<br />
I was taken to a High Church;<br />
The parson's name was Mowbray,<br />
"Which is a good name but he thinks too much of it&mdash;"<br />
That's what I heard people say.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
I took a little black book<br />
To that cold, grey, damp, smelling church,<br />
And I had to sit on a hard bench,<br />
Wriggle off it to kneel down when they sang psalms,<br />
And wriggle off it to kneel down when they prayed&mdash;<br />
And then there was nothing to do<br />
Except to play trains with the hymn-books.<br />
<br />
There was nothing to see,<br />
Nothing to do,<br />
Nothing to play with,<br />
Except that in an empty room upstairs<br />
There was a large tin box<br />
Containing reproductions of the Magna Charta,<br />
Of the Declaration of Independence<br />
And of a letter from Raleigh after the Armada.<br />
There were also several packets of stamps,<br />
Yellow and blue Guatemala parrots,<br />
Blue stags and red baboons and birds from Sarawak,<br />
Indians and Men-of-war<br />
From the United States,<br />
And the green and red portraits<br />
Of King Francobollo<br />
Of Italy.</td></tr>

Amid the broken flutings of white pillars.<br />
It dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hair,<br />
And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses.<br />
How light and laughing my mind is,<br />
When all the good folk have put out their bed-room candles,<br />
And the city is still!</td></tr></table>

<h4>THE BOMBARDMENT</h4>

<p>Slowly, without force, the rain drops into the city. It stops a moment on
the carved head of Saint John, then slides on again, slipping and
trickling over his stone cloak. It splashes from the lead conduit of a
gargoyle, and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral
square. Where are the people, and why does the fretted steeple sweep about
in the sky? Boom! The sound swings against the rain. Boom, again! After
it, only water rushing in the gutters, and the turmoil from the spout of
the gargoyle. Silence. Ripples and mutters. Boom!</p>

<p>The room is damp, but warm. Little flashes swarm about from the firelight.
The lustres of the chandelier are bright, and clusters of rubies leap in
the bohemian glasses on the <i>&eacute;tag&egrave;re</i>. Her hands are restless, but the
white masses of her hair are quite still. Boom! Will it never cease to
torture, this iteration! Boom! The vibration shatters a glass on the
<i>&eacute;tag&egrave;re</i>. It lies there formless and glowing, with all its crimson gleams
shot out of pattern, spilled, flowing red, blood-red. A thin bell-note
pricks through the silence. A door creaks. The old lady speaks: "Victor,
clear away that broken glass." "Alas! Madame, the bohemian glass!" "Yes,
Victor, one hundred years ago my father brought it&mdash;" Boom! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> room
shakes, the servitor quakes. Another goblet shivers and breaks. Boom!</p>

<p>It rustles at the window-pane, the smooth, streaming rain, and he is shut
within its clash and murmur. Inside is his candle, his table, his ink, his
pen, and his dreams. He is thinking, and the walls are pierced with beams
of sunshine, slipping through young green. A fountain tosses itself up at
the blue sky, and through the spattered water in the basin he can see
copper carp, lazily floating among cold leaves. A wind-harp in a
cedar-tree grieves and whispers, and words blow into his brain, bubbled,
iridescent, shooting up like flowers of fire, higher and higher. Boom! The
flame-flowers snap on their slender stems. The fountain rears up in long
broken spears of disheveled water and flattens into the earth. Boom! And
there is only the room, the table, the candle, and the sliding rain.
Again, Boom!&mdash;Boom!&mdash;Boom! He stuffs his fingers into his ears. He sees
corpses, and cries out in fright. Boom! It is night, and they are shelling
the city! Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>A child wakes and is afraid, and weeps in the darkness. What has made the
bed shake? "Mother, where are you? I am awake." "Hush, my Darling, I am
here." "But, Mother, something so queer happened, the room shook." Boom!
"Oh! What is it? What is the matter?" Boom!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> "Where is Father? I am so
afraid." Boom! The child sobs and shrieks. The house trembles and creaks.
Boom!</p>

<p>Retorts, globes, tubes, and phials lie shattered. All his trials oozing
across the floor. The life that was his choosing, lonely, urgent, goaded
by a hope, all gone. A weary man in a ruined laboratory, that was his
story. Boom! Gloom and ignorance, and the jig of drunken brutes. Diseases
like snakes crawling over the earth, leaving trails of slime. Wails from
people burying their dead. Through the window he can see the rocking
steeple. A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof, and the sky tears
apart on a spike of flame. Up the spire, behind the lacings of stone,
zig-zagging in and out of the carved tracings, squirms the fire. It spouts
like yellow wheat from the gargoyles, coils round the head of Saint John,
and aureoles him in light. It leaps into the night and hisses against the
rain. The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white, wet night.</p>

<p>Boom! The Cathedral is a torch, and the houses next to it begin to scorch.
Boom! The bohemian glass on the <i>&eacute;tag&egrave;re</i> is no longer there. Boom! A
stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains. The old lady cannot
walk. She watches the creeping stalk and counts. Boom!&mdash;Boom!&mdash;Boom!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>The poet rushes into the street, and the rain wraps him in a sheet of
silver. But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads. The
city burns. Quivering, spearing, thrusting, lapping, streaming, run the
flames. Over roofs, and walls, and shops, and stalls. Smearing its gold on
the sky the fire dances, lances itself through the doors, and lisps and
chuckles along the floors.</p>

<p>The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower flickering
at the window. The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams.</p>

<p>The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning
Cathedral. Now the streets are swarming with people. They seek shelter and
crowd into the cellars. They shout and call, and over all, slowly and
without force, the rain drops into the city. Boom! And the steeple crashes
down among the people. Boom! Boom, again! The water rushes along the
gutters. The fire roars and mutters. Boom!</p>
